reason from first principles rather than by 
analogy 

so the normal way that we conduct our lives is we 
we we reason by analogy 

we're doing this because it's like something else 
that was done or it's like what other people are 
doing

me to type ideas yeah it's like yeah a
slight iteration yeah on a theme 

and and and it's it because it's it's kind of
mentally easier to reason by analogy rather than 
from first principles 

but but first principles is kind of a physics way 
of looking at the world and what that really means 

is you kind of boil things down to the most 
fundamental truths and and say okay what do we 
sure is true or sure as possible is true 

and then reason up from there that takes a
lot more mental energy 

give me an example that like what's one thing that 
you've done that on that you feels work for you

sure so somebody could say in fact people do that 
battery packs are really expensive and that's just 
the way they'll always be because that's the way 
they've been in the past

you're like well no that's that's pretty
dumb you know because 

if if you apply that reasoning to anything new 
that then you wouldn't be able to ever get to that
new thing right 

so you know it's like you can't say oh you know 
horses nobody wants a car because horses are
great and we're used to them and they can eat 
grass there's lots of grass all over the place and 

you know there's not like there's no gasoline if 
you book and buy so people never going to it never
get ever going to get cars right that people did 
say that and 

in for batteries they would say oh it's going to 
cost you know the historically its cost six six
hundred dollars probe six hundred dollars per 
kilowatt hour and 

so it's not going to be much better than that in
the future and say no okay well what
what are the batteries made of 

so first principles would be say okay what are the 
material constituents of the batteries?

what is the spot market value of the material 
constituents?

so you can say okay it's got cobalt nickel 
aluminum, carbon and some polymers for separation
and a steel can 

so break that down on a material basis and say 
okay what if we bought that in london metal 
exchange what would each of those things costs
like oh geez it's like $80 a per kilowatt hour 

so clearly you just need to think of clever ways 
to take those materials and combine them into the
shape of a battery cell and you can have batteries 
that are much much cheaper than anyone realizes
