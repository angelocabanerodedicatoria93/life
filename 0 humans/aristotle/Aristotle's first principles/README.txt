1 the problem of first principles

1. first principles

 first principles (or 'origins') 
 
 in every systematic inquiry (methodos) where 
 there are first principles, or causes, or 
 elements, knowledge and science result from 
 acquiring knowledge of these

 for we think we know something just in case we 
 acquire knowledge of the primary causes

 the primary first principles, all the way to the 
 elements

 it is clear, then, that in the science of nature 
 as elsewhere, we should try first to determine 
 questions about the first principles 

 the naturally proper direction of our road is 
 from things better known and clearer to us

 to things that are clearer and better known by
 nature

 for the things known to us are not the same as 
 the things known unconditionally

 hence it is necessary for us to progress, 
 following this procedure

 from the things that are less clear by natrue,
 but clearer to us, towards things that are 
 clearer and better known by nature

 the connexion between knowledge and first 
 principles is expressed in aristotle's account of
 a first principle (in one sense) as 
 
 'the first basis from which a thing is known'

 the search for first principles is not peculiar
 to philosophy

 philosophy shares this aim with biological, 
 meteorological, and historical inquiries, among 
 others

 but aristotle's reference to first principles in 
 this opening passage of the physics and at the 
 start of other philosophical inquiries imply that 
 it is a primary task of philosophy

 it is easy to see why aristotle says we should 
 begin with what is better known and more familiar
 to us

 we have to begin with the beliefs we initially
 accept

 but his account of the goal of inquiry is more 
 puzzling

 he suggests that the first principles are known 
 and clearer 'by nature' or 'unconditionally'

 even if they are less well-known and less clear 
 to us 

 aristotle explains the point by analogy

 someone may be a 'natural musician', because he 
 is naturally suited for it, even if he never 
 learns music, and so never becomes a musician

 and presumably what is known unconditionally is 
 not what is known to everyone

 but what is known to those in a good intellectual 
 condition, just as what is unconditionally 
 healthy is what is healthy for those in a good 
 bodily condition 

 first principles are known unconditionally 
 because they are naturally appropriate for being
 known

 the beliefs we begin with are 'prior to us'

 'prior from our point of view' since they are 
 what we begin from 

 but the principles we find will be 'prior by 
 nature', and when we have found them they will 
 also be 'prior to us'

 for then we will recognize that they are more 
 basic and primary than the principles we begin 
 from

 the first principles we find will include beliefs 
 and propositions 

 but aritstotle also regards things non-linguistic
 , non-psychological, non-propositional entities 
 as first principles

 we come to know that there are four elements, and
 this proposition what we know is a first 
 principle

 but the four elements themselves are also first 
 principles and are prior and better known by 
 nature 

 actually existing things are first principles 
 because they explain other things

 and our knowledge of the world requires us to 
 know the explanatory relations in it 

 to have scientific knowledge (episteme) about 
 birds is to be able to explain why birds are as
 they are and behave as they do

 the things and processes that explain others are 
 basic and fundamental

 when we have found them, we have found the first 
 principles of birds

 what is prior and better known by nature is both
 the propositional principle about, e.g.

 atoms, and the real principle mentioned in the 
 proposition the atoms themselves

 we grasp both sorts of principles at the same 
 time and in the same way

 it is intelligible that when aristotle speaks of 
 first principles, he speaks indifferently of 
 propositions and of the things they refer to

 for the relations between non-propositional 
 things in the world, not the relations between 
 our beliefs

 make one rather than another proposition a first 
 principle 

 we grasp propositional first principles, and they 
 become 'known to us'

 when our beliefs match the appropriate 
 propositional principles that match the 
 appropriate non-propositional principles

 once we believe a propositional first principle,
 we certainly connect it to our other beliefs in 
 specific ways

 but the beliefs and the connexions do not make it 
 a first principle 

 it is a first principle because of the facts 
 external to our beliefs, and we have the correct 
 beliefs in the correct connexions only in so far 
 as we describe the relations between facts 
 independent of our beliefs

 let us say that in so far aw we do this, we grasp
 'objective' (propositional) first principles 
 describing the (non-propositional) first 
 principles of an objective reality?

2. realism
================================================== 






















================================================== 
Aristotle describes two methods of inquiry that 
begin from our initial beliefs and the things we 
intuitively recognise

the ‘things known to us’, and claim to reach 
principles ‘known by nature’ 

Empirical inquiry begins from perception, 
proceeds by induction and generalisation, and 
tests theories by appeal to experience

Dialectic inquiry begins from common beliefs, 
proceeds by raising and solving puzzles, 
and tests theories against common beliefs 

Distinguishing these two methods is useful since 
they suggest two ways of passing the metaphysical 
realist test for genuine first principle
