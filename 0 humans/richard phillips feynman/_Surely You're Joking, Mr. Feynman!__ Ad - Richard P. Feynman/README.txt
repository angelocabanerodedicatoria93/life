nobel prize-winning physicist richard p. feynman
atomic physics with einstein and bohr
gambling with nick the greek
painting a naked female toreador
accompanying a ballet on his bongo drums
a new york times bestseller
more than 500,000 copies sold

as told to ralph leighton, edited by edward hutchings

this book were collected intermittently and informally during seven years of very enjoyable drumming with richard feynman
the one person could have so many wonderfully crazy things happen to him in one life is sometimes hard to believe

his almost compulsive need to solve puzzles, provocative mishievousness, indignant impatience
pretension and hypocrisy, talent for one-upping anybody who tries to one-up him
he picked up the chalk and began spinning it rapidly through his finters in a manner of a professional gambler playing with a poker chip still smiling happily
