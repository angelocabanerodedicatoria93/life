 two-year course in physics

 physicist

 if you are going to be a physicist, you will have 
 a lot to study: two hundred years of the most 
 rapidly developing field of knowledge that there 
 is, so much knowledge, in fact

 that you might think that you cannot learn all of 
 it in four years, and truly you cannot, you will
 have to go to graduate school too

 to find laws which summarize all our knowledge

 the laws are so hard to grasp that it is unfair 
 to you to start exploring this tremendous subject 
 without some kind of map or outline of the 
 relationship of one part of the subject of 
 science to another

 the first three chapters will therefore outline 
 the relation of physics to the rest of the 
 sciences, the relations of the sciences to each 
 other, and the meaning of science, to help us 
 develop a "feel" for the subject

 basic laws on page one and then showing how they 
 work in all possible circumstances

 euclidean geometry, where we state the axioms and
 then make all sorts of deductions

 so, not satisfied to learn physics in four years, 
 you want to learn it in four minutes? we cannot 
 do it in this way for two reasons

 first, we do not yet know all the basic laws: 
 there is an expanding frontier of ignorance

 second, the correct statement of the laws of 
 physics involves some very unfamiliar ideas which 
 require advanced mathematics for their 
 description

 therefore, one needs a considerable amount of 
 preparatory training even to learn what the words 
 mean, no, it is not possible to do it that way, 
 we can only do it piece by piece

 each piece, or part, of the whole of nature is 
 always merely an approximation to the complete 
 truth, or the complete truth so far as we know it
 in fact, everything we know is only some kind of 
 approximation

 because we know that we do not know all the laws 
 as yet

 therefore, things must be learned only to be 
 unlearned again or, more likely, to be corrected

 the principle of science, the definition, almost, 
 is the following: the test of all knowledge is 
 experiment

 experiment is the sole judge of scientific"truth"

 but what is the source of knowledge?
 where do the laws that are to be tested comefrom?

 experiment, itself, helps to produce these laws,
 in the sense that it gives us hints

 but also needed is imagination to create from 
 these hints the great generalizations

 this imagining process is so difficult that there
 is a division of labor in physics

 theoretical physicists who imagine, deduce, and 
 guess at new laws, but do not experiment

 experimental physicists who experiment, imagine,
 deduce, and guess

 we said that the laws of nature are approximate

 that we first find the "wrong" ones, and then we 
 find the "right" ones, now, how can an experiment 
 be "wrong"?

 first, in a trivial way: if something is wrong 
 with the apparatus that you did not notice, but 
 these things are easily fixed, and checked back
 and forth

 so without snatching at such minor things, how 
 can the results of an experiment be wrong?

 only by being inaccurate, for example, the mass 
 of an object never seems to change: a spinning 
 top has the same weight as a still one

 so a "law" was invented: mass is constant, 
 independent of speed 

 that "law" is now found to be incorrect, mass is 
 found to increase with velocity

 but appreciable increases require velocities near 
 that of light

 a true law is: if an object moves with a speed of
 less than one hundred miles a second the mass is 
 constant to within one part in a million, in some
 such approximate form this is a correct law

 so in pactice one might think that the new law 
 makes no significant difference, well, yes and no

 for ordinary speeds we can certainly forget it 
 and use the simple constant-mass law as a good 
 approximation 

 but for high speeds we are wrong, and the higher 
 the
