1-1 introduction

 two-year course in physics

 physicist

 if you are going to be a physicist, you will have 
 a lot to study: two hundred years of the most 
 rapidly developing field of knowledge that there 
 is, so much knowledge, in fact

 that you might think that you cannot learn all of 
 it in four years, and truly you cannot, you will
 have to go to graduate school too

 to find laws which summarize all our knowledge

 the laws are so hard to grasp that it is unfair 
 to you to start exploring this tremendous subject 
 without some kind of map or outline of the 
 relationship of one part of the subject of 
 science to another

 the first three chapters will therefore outline 
 the relation of physics to the rest of the 
 sciences, the relations of the sciences to each 
 other, and the meaning of science, to help us 
 develop a "feel" for the subject

 basic laws on page one and then showing how they 
 work in all possible circumstances

 euclidean geometry, where we state the axioms and
 then make all sorts of deductions

 so, not satisfied to learn physics in four years, 
 you want to learn it in four minutes? we cannot 
 do it in this way for two reasons

 first, we do not yet know all the basic laws: 
 there is an expanding frontier of ignorance

 second, the correct statement of the laws of 
 physics involves some very unfamiliar ideas which 
 require advanced mathematics for their 
 description

 therefore, one needs a considerable amount of 
 preparatory training even to learn what the words 
 mean, no, it is not possible to do it that way, 
 we can only do it piece by piece

 each piece, or part, of the whole of nature is 
 always merely an approximation to the complete 
 truth, or the complete truth so far as we know it
 in fact, everything we know is only some kind of 
 approximation

 because we know that we do not know all the laws 
 as yet

 therefore, things must be learned only to be 
 unlearned again or, more likely, to be corrected

 the principle of science, the definition, almost, 
 is the following: the test of all knowledge is 
 experiment

 experiment is the sole judge of scientific"truth"

 but what is the source of knowledge?
 where do the laws that are to be tested comefrom?

 experiment, itself, helps to produce these laws,
 in the sense that it gives us hints

 but also needed is imagination to create from 
 these hints the great generalizations

 this imagining process is so difficult that there
 is a division of labor in physics

 theoretical physicists who imagine, deduce, and 
 guess at new laws, but do not experiment

 experimental physicists who experiment, imagine,
 deduce, and guess

 we said that the laws of nature are approximate

 that we first find the "wrong" ones, and then we 
 find the "right" ones, now, how can an experiment 
 be "wrong"?

 first, in a trivial way: if something is wrong 
 with the apparatus that you did not notice, but 
 these things are easily fixed, and checked back
 and forth

 so without snatching at such minor things, how 
 can the results of an experiment be wrong?

 only by being inaccurate, for example, the mass 
 of an object never seems to change: a spinning 
 top has the same weight as a still one

 so a "law" was invented: mass is constant, 
 independent of speed 

 that "law" is now found to be incorrect, mass is 
 found to increase with velocity

 but appreciable increases require velocities near 
 that of light

 a true law is: if an object moves with a speed of
 less than one hundred miles a second the mass is 
 constant to within one part in a million, in some
 such approximate form this is a correct law

 so in pactice one might think that the new law 
 makes no significant difference, well, yes and no

 for ordinary speeds we can certainly forget it 
 and use the simple constant-mass law as a good 
 approximation 

 but for high speeds we are wrong, and the higher 
 the speed, the more wrong we are

 philosophically we are completely wrong with the 
 approximate law

 our entire pciture of the world has to be altered 
 even though the mass changes only by a little bit

 this is a very peculiar thing about the 
 philosophy, or the ideas, behind laws  

 even a very small effect sometimes requires 
 profound changes in our ideas

 what should we teach first? should we teach the 
 correct but unfamiliar law with its strange and 
 difficult conceptual ideas, for example the 
 theory of relativity, four-dimensional space-time
 and so on?

 or should we first teach the simple 
 "constant-mass" law, which is only approximate,
 but does not involve such difficult ideas?

 the first is more exciting, more wonderful, and 
 more fun, but the second is easier to get at 
 first, and is a first step to a real 
 understanding of the first idea

 this point arises again and again in teaching 
 physics
 
 at different times we shall have to resovle it in 
 teaching physics

 but at each stage it is worth learning what is 
 now known, how accurate it is, how it fits into
 everything else, and how it may be changed when 
 we learn more

 let us now proceed with our outline, or general 
 map, of our understanding of science today (in 
 particular, physics, but also of other sciences 
 on the periphery) 
 
 so that when we later concentrate on some 
 particular point we will have some idea of the 
 background

 why that particular point is interesting, and how
 it fits into the big structure, so , what is our 
 over-all picture of the world?
    
1-2 matter is made of atoms

 if, in some cataclysm, all of scientific 
 knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one 
 sentence passed on to the next generations of 
 creatures 
 
 what statement would contain the most information 
 in the fewest words? 
 
 i believe it is the atomic hypothesis (or the 
 atomic fact, or whatever you wish to call it)

 that all things are made of atoms - little 
 particles that move around in perpetual motion,
 attracting each other when they are a little 
 distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed 
 into one another 

 in that one sentence, you will see,there is an 
 enormous amount of information about the world,
 if just a little imagination and thinking are 
 applied 

 water magnified one billion times
 figure 1-1

 to illustrate the power of the atomic idea, 
 suppose that we have a drop of water a quarter of 
 an inch on the sidem 
 
 if we look at it very closely we see nothing but 
 water - smooth, continuos water, 

 even if we magnify it with the best optical 
 microscope available - roughly two thousand times 

 then the water drop will be roughly forty feet 
 across
