when you're thinking about something that you 
don't understand, you have a terrible, 
uncomfortable feeling called confusion

its a very difficult and unhappy business and so 
most of the time you rather unhappy actually with 
this confusion you can't penetrate this thing

now is it the confusion because were all some kind 
of apes that a kind of stupid working against this 

trying to figure out to put the two sticks 
together to reach the banana we can't quite make 
it the idea and yeah i get this feeling all the
time that i am an ape trying to put two sticks 
together 

so i always feels stupid once in a while though 

the sticks go together on me and i reach the 
banana

The first principle is that you must not fool 
yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.

================================================== 

What I cannot create, I do not understand.

================================================== 

I learned very early the difference between 
knowing the name of something and knowing 
something.

================================================== 

Study hard what interests you the most in the most 
undisciplined, irreverent and original manner 
possible.

I think it's much more interesting to live not 
knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. 

================================================== 

The highest forms of understanding we can achieve 
are laughter and human compassion.

================================================== 

We are trying to prove ourselves wrong as quickly 
as possible, because only in that way can we find 
progress.

================================================== 

I don't know what's the matter with people: they 
don't learn by understanding, they learn by some 
other way â€” by rote or something. Their knowledge 
is so fragile!

================================================== 

Religion is a culture of faith; science is a 
culture of doubt.

================================================== 

Physics isn't the most important thing. Love is.
