    <p>This is one of the ways you could have solved the challenge using a while loop. There are many others, as long as
        you achieve the desired outcome -printing the lyrics to the 99 bottles of beer song- then you are successful! If
        you've come up with a fancy solution or something different, be sure to share it in the Q&amp;A section for
        other students to learn from!</p>
    <p>If you want to challenge yourself further, try changing the code to make the english more grammatically correct.
        So the final output should say "1 <strong>bottle</strong> of beer on the wall" when <code>numberOfBottles</code>
        is equal to <code>1</code> rather than "1 <strong>bottles</strong> of beer on the wall" and when
        <code>numberOfBottles</code> is equal to <code>0</code>, you can make the output "<strong>No more</strong>
        bottles of beer on the wall" instead of <strong>0</strong> bottles of beer on the wall".</p>
