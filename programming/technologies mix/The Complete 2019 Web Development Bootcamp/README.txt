                           2019 sep 14 13:59 02 06
 internet is a long piece of wire 
 server, client, a web server open 24/7 like a 
 library

 client, www.google.com => internet service 
 provider like (at&t & comcast in us)(bt & 
 talktalk) => dns server (domain name system) like 
 a phone book
 www.google.com ... dns server will look up its 
 database what is the exact ip address of that 
 website that your trying to access ... 
 216.58.210.4 every single computer thats 
 connected to the internet has an ip address like 
 postal address for your computer once the dns
 server finds the ip address it sends back to your 
 borwser 

 216.58.210.4 direct request to that address => 
 internet service provider => internet backbone
 internet backbone = submarine cable map 
 https://www.submarinecablemap.com

 internet is made up of huge wires connecting all 
 of world internet users 

 216.58.210.46 => internet service provider => 
 internet backbone => server 216.58.210.46 
 google server send back to the client through the 
 internet backbone

7. How Do Websites Actually Work
                           2019 sep 14 14:29 03 07
 browser
  chrome, safari, firefox this are all pieces of 
  software that allow you to lookup the ip address

 code files
  html = structure
  css  = style
  js   = behaviour

 if you changing a content in a website in your 
 developer tools your changing the local copy of 
 this website that you got back from the google 
 service for example click refresh that makes a 
 new request to the google service to load up a 
 new copy of the website and update to the 
 original content so the change that you made will 
 be remove

  computation and business logic
  and return the webpage that contain the new data 
  netscape wanted something different = dynamic 
  with animation, real time user interaction in 
  order to enable this remove the server have the 
  code to run on the browser they make a small 
  scripting language, the language must be simple 
  easy to add functionality to the website
  they contracted brendan eich to create that 
  programming language 
  brendan able to make language in 10 days

 google chrome, settings, search javascript, 
 content settings, javascript, allowed = switch 
 off https://twitter.com, https://www.nytimes.com,

   brad = <p>

  unhide h1
  1s delay
  undhide p
  h1 change text to "hello"
  p change text to "world"

 java vs javascript to have same name = popularity 

 interpreted = javascript, python, ruby
 compiled    = java, c/c++, swift

 compiled    = serious very fast programs 

 modern javascript is use in all sorts of places 
  traditionally it is a frontend language 
  frameworks in frontend & backend 
  browser support
